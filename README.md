# LaTeX-Basics---Lunch-Session (EN)
This repository contains the sample files used in the LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session (30 minutes).

## Brief description of the LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session

Usually, texts are created with a word processing package (OpenOffice, LibreOffice or Microsoft Office). However, for professional and/or very large documents (especially in the mathematical-technical area) the possibilities of such standard Office packages are not sufficient. LaTeX is a text typesetting system that meets these requirements. Those who are used to a word processor will find the introduction to LaTeX very hard to get used to. Creating documents with LaTeX is closer to programming with a page description language than to entering text with standard WYSIWYG office packages. In this basic session, a first overview of LaTeX, the features of LaTeX and the required components will be given. A first small LaTeX document will be created with the online LaTeX editor Overleaf (the easy to use, online, collaborative LaTeX editor).

## Contents of the LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session

- Differences between LaTeX and Word
- What is needed to create LaTeX documents
- File / folder structure for LaTeX documents
- A first, short LaTeX document with Overleaf
- Entering text in LaTeX
- Mathematical formulas
- Images/graphics
- References and bibliography
- Hints for installing and configuring a LaTeX environment on your own laptop
- Hints for further LaTeX courses and materials

More about LaTeX can be found in the LaTeX - Workshop (see own repository). Furthermore there is a LaTeX tutorial with an extensive LaTeX document which covers a lot of topics (different directories, bibliography, images, tables, citation, mathematical formulas, etc.).

## Target audience of the LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session

The LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session is intended for students who have no previous experience with LaTeX. Students who have already created a document with LaTeX will not learn anything new. We recommend that they attend the LaTeX-Basics - Workshop, which can now also be attended without completing the Lunch Session.
